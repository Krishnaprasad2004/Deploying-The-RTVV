# Deploying-The-RTVV
This project involves researching app deployment, creating a web page for downloads, and inviting users to provide feedback via a survey. Students will apply for ethics approval and collect user data. The project includes collaboration with two clients—one in Hong Kong and one in Ballarat—who will offer guidance throughout the process.
